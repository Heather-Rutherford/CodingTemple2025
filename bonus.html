      <h2 style="color: navy;">About me</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Heather Rutherford.
      </p>
      <h3 style="color: navy;">The Professional Me</h3>
      <p>I worked as a systems analyst
        7 years ago. After I quit working, I moved into Tutoring.<br />
        Then COVID happened. About a year ago, my husband was let go from his
        job and we relocated<br />
        to the Cumberland Plateau in Tennessee. I have tried finding employment
        <br />but as my computer skills are quite old, I have been unsuccessful
        at finding employment.<br />Thus, I have decided to brush up my skills
        to make myself more marketable.
      </p>
      <h3 style="color: navy;">The Nonprofessional Me - The Favorite Me</h3>
      <p style="font-size: larger;">
        I inherited the love of traveling from my dad and both my maternal and paternal 
        grandparents. That means I've got the travel bug bad.<br />
        I also am a question asker. I come by it naturally. My dad is the
        original question asker.<br/>

        I love quotes and other silly sayings. The following is from the
        OldTimers group on Facebook. 
        I hope it brings a smile to your day.<p/>
        I've been to a lot of places, but I've never been in Cahoots. Apparently
        you can't go alone, you have to be in Cahoots with someone. I've also
        never been in Cognito, either. I hear no one recognizes you there. I
        have, however, been in Sane. They don't have an airport, you have to be
        driven there. I have made several trips.
