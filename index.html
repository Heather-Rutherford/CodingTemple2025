    <h1>Welcome to My Web Page</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Heather Rutherford.<br /><br />I worked as a systems analyst 7
      years ago. After I quit working, I moved into Tutoring.<br />
      Then COVID happened. About a year ago, my husband was let go from his job
      and we relocated<br />
      to the Cumberland Plateau in Tennessee. I have tried finding employment
      <br />but as my computer skills are quite old, I have been unsuccessful at
      finding employment.<br />Thus, I have decided to brush up my skills to
      make myself more marketable.

    <p>
      I inherited the love of traveling from my dad and my maternal
      grandparents.<br />
      I also am a question asker. I come by it naturally. My dad is the original
      question asker.
